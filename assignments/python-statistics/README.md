# 📘 Assignment: Statistics with Python

## 🎯 Objective

Master statistical analysis and data manipulation using pandas and numpy. You'll learn to load, clean, analyze, and interpret data using statistical calculations and exploratory data analysis techniques while developing skills to extract meaningful insights from datasets.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas

#### Description

Build programs that load, explore, and analyze datasets using pandas. Learn fundamental statistical operations and data manipulation techniques to understand the structure and characteristics of datasets.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Load data from CSV and Excel files into DataFrames
- Display and inspect data (head, tail, shape, info, describe)
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std, variance)
- Handle missing values (detect, remove, fill)
- Create data summaries and value counts for categorical columns
- Sort and filter data based on conditions
- Group data by categories and calculate aggregate statistics


### 🛠️ Perform Statistical Calculations with NumPy

#### Description

Implement statistical calculations and numerical operations using numpy arrays. Learn to perform mathematical operations efficiently on large datasets and understand probability distributions.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Create and manipulate numpy arrays
- Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, std, variance, percentiles)
- Perform mathematical operations and transformations
- Generate random numbers from various distributions
- Calculate correlation and covariance matrices
- Perform linear algebra operations (matrices, vectors)
- Use numpy functions for efficient numerical computing


### 🛠️ Conduct Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

#### Description

Apply advanced statistical techniques to answer data-driven questions. Perform hypothesis tests, calculate confidence intervals, and analyze relationships between variables to draw evidence-based conclusions from data.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Calculate correlation between variables
- Perform t-tests and other hypothesis tests
- Calculate confidence intervals for estimates
- Create contingency tables and analyze relationships
- Perform regression analysis to model relationships
- Analyze distributions and test for normality
