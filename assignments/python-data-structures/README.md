# 📘 Assignment: Data Structures in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Master the fundamental data structures in Python including lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. You'll learn to choose the right data structure for different problems, manipulate collections effectively, and understand their performance characteristics while building practical programs that demonstrate efficient data handling.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Implement List and Tuple Operations

#### Description

Create programs that demonstrate proficiency with lists and tuples. Build functions that perform common operations and manipulate these sequential data structures in various ways, understanding the differences between mutable and immutable sequences.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Create, access, and modify lists using indexing and slicing
- Implement list methods (append, insert, remove, pop, sort, reverse)
- Perform list comprehensions to create new lists
- Create tuples and understand their immutability
- Convert between lists and tuples
- Use tuple unpacking and multi-assignment
- Sort lists and tuples by different criteria


### 🛠️ Master Dictionaries and Sets

#### Description

Build applications using dictionaries and sets to store and manipulate key-value pairs and unique values. Understand when to use these data structures and implement operations that showcase their unique characteristics and efficiency advantages.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Create and populate dictionaries with various data types
- Access and modify dictionary values using keys
- Implement dictionary methods (keys, values, items, get, pop, update)
- Use dictionary comprehensions
- Create sets and perform set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Implement set methods for finding unique values
- Use nested data structures (lists of dicts, dicts of lists)
- Choose appropriate data structures for specific use cases


### 🛠️ Build a Data Structure Application

#### Description

Create a practical application that combines multiple data structures to solve a real-world problem. Your program should efficiently organize and process data using the appropriate structures for each component.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Use multiple data structures in a single program
- Implement efficient searching and sorting operations
- Handle and filter data based on specific criteria
- Process user input and manage collections of records
- Demonstrate knowledge of time/space complexity considerations
- Include proper error handling for data manipulation
- Organize code with helper functions for data operations
