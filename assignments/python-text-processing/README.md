# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Master string manipulation, file input/output operations, and text processing techniques in Python. You'll build practical programs that read, analyze, and transform text files while learning about string methods, file handling, and data extraction.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build a Text Analysis Tool

#### Description

Create a program that reads a text file and performs various analyses on the content. Your tool should process the text and provide useful statistics and transformations, demonstrating proficiency with string methods and file I/O.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Read text from a file with proper error handling
- Count total words, characters, and lines in the text
- Find and count occurrences of specific words
- Convert text to uppercase and lowercase
- Remove punctuation and extra whitespace
- Display analysis results in a formatted output
- Handle file not found and other I/O exceptions gracefully


### 🛠️ Implement Text Transformation Features

#### Description

Extend your program with advanced text manipulation features. Build functionality to filter, transform, and export processed text in different formats while maintaining data integrity.

#### Requirements

Completed program should:

- Search for and replace specific text patterns
- Extract lines containing specific keywords
- Reverse text or individual words
- Write processed text to a new output file
- Support reading and writing multiple file formats
- Implement text filtering (remove stop words, filter by word length)
- Generate a summary report with transformation statistics
